## Inspiration
As students who have to use multiple resources to find their grades at CU Boulder, we wanted to work on an idea that would better aid students to quickly know their grades.
## What it does
BoldMetrics fetches data of the current classes the student is taking and the associated grades and tests. It allows for students to quickly see their grades by being on one central location.
## How we built it
Our team heavily used React to create a dynamic framework with multiple components. We used GraphQL to better communicate with our BackEnd with the help of Hasura and Apollo. To stylize our FrontEnd, we used the Bloomer dependency as well as common .css
## Challenges we ran into
Our team ran into multiple challenges throughout the Hackathon, mostly with querying and passing data between pages. Because we had troubles with querying, we spent a large portion of our time on working on a user authentication system that was never implemented.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a team, we are very proud of our BackEnd schema as it features many-to-many and one-to-many relationships. We are also very happy that we were able to create dynamic webpages that updated with different information based on various ids passed. Also, we are very proud that we successfully populated a graph with queried data.
## What we learned
Although we all came from different backgrounds, we all became more familiar with React and integrating a BackEnd system. As well as React, we all got more comfortable using version control with git.
## What's next for Islanders
We hope to continue developing BoldMetrics until it meets our vision we first had. This includes a secure user authentication, complete graph integration with our data base, and a clean UI/UX.
